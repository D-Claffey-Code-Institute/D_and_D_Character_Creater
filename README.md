## **Purpose of the game**
<p>This program was designed to create random characters for a session of Dungeons and Dragons. It will assign a name, class, race, ability scores and alignment for a character.</p>
------

## **Why Create This Program**
<p>Sometimes you need a little help when creating characters for a Dungeons and Dragons session or as a new player you just want to get stuck in! </p>
------

## **Features**
### **Existing Features**
<p>From the start of the program you will see a large title using ASCII to welcome users, followed by the instructions to start</p>

<p>You start by creating the name, either write in the first name followed by the second name, or if you want either name randomly selected for you leave the space blank and hit enter</p>
<br>
<p>The program will then run and create a character for you</p>
<br>
<p>After the program will ask you if you would like to continue, or if not, it will exit</p>
------

### **Future Features**
#### **Initiative Tracker**
<p>In a session of D and D, an Initiative Tracker represents the order in which players act in a combat. In a future update I will add this feature for the created characters as well as a number of enemy characters</p>
